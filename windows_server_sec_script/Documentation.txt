The following script automates the process of securing your Windows client system based on CIS benchmarks.
This script has been tested on Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2016, and Windows Server 2019.

1. Copy the contents for this script to either an external drive, local drive or virtual drive on your Windows system.

2. Rename the letter Drive to r:\  or some letter that you prefer. Note that a find and replace of the drive letter will 
have to be used to modify this script in order for it to work correctly. For demonstrated purposes in this case, I'm using the r:\drive.

3. Open up a Powershell command prompt and execute cd r:\windows_server_sec_script

4. Execute the following command: .\winserversecv2.ps1.

5. You have now secured your Windows server system.  Please execute this script only within a non-production environment and always 
ask permission before executing the script in any client environment.
