This script has only been tested on Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and Windows 11.
The following script automates the process of securing your Windows client system based on CIS benchmarks. 

1. Copy the contents for this script to either an external drive, local drive or virtual drive on your Windows system.

2. Rename the letter Drive to r:\  or some letter that you prefer. Note that a find and replace of the drive letter will 
have to be used to modify this script in order for it to work correctly. For demonstrated purposes in this case, I'm using the r:\drive.

3. Open up a Powershell command prompt and execute cd r:\winclient_sec_script\

4. Execute the following command: .\winclientsecv2.ps1.

5. You have now have secured your Windows client system. Please execute this script only within a non-production 
environment and always ask permission before executing this script in any client environment.
